I created different folders for sheets.
when I run the app the index.html that will contain the answers will be created in dist folder.

when you run the index.js,
it will ask you first about your manager, 
then you will have an option to either finish or choose engineer and intern. 
you can add both. 
it will add cards in the index.html that will be created after you hit finsh.
